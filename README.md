FGOC: Focal-Geometry and Curvature Classifier

A deterministic, <1 ms/arc classifier for LSST DIASource-level short-arc geometry and curvature diagnostics.

FGOC provides an ultra-lightweight geometric–curvature analysis designed for early identification of dynamically unusual DIASource tracklets during LSST Prompt Processing.
The module runs directly on short-arc RA/DEC/MJD data, performs no orbit fitting, introduces no side effects, and requires zero modifications to existing AP/MOPS code paths.

FGOC is designed to complement existing LSST pipelines by supplying a deterministic, fast, fully reversible diagnostic layer for early anomaly detection and shadow-mode evaluation of astrometric stability.

Features

Deterministic — No orbit fitting, no stochastic sampling, no optimization.

Ultra-fast — <1 ms per short arc.

Non-invasive — Reads only DIASource RA/DEC/MJD.

Reversible and isolated — Safe for shadow-mode execution.

Pipeline-compatible — Designed to sit before or alongside the MOPS Pre-Linker.

Geometry-driven outputs:

fgoc_flag — Boolean anomaly indicator

fgoc_score — Normalized anomaly score

focal_axis — Estimated great-circle axis

curvature_sign — +1 or –1

Installation

FGOC depends only on NumPy.

pip install numpy

Quick Start

from fgoc import fgoc

ra = [10.0, 10.002, 10.004]
dec = [20.0, 20.001, 20.002]
mjd = [60000.0, 60000.01, 60000.02]

flag, score, axis, sign = fgoc(ra, dec, mjd)

print("FGOC flag:", flag)
print("FGOC score:", score)
print("Axis:", axis)
print("Curvature sign:", sign)

Typical runtime: 0.3–0.8 ms per arc

Method Overview

FGOC operates entirely in spherical focal-plane geometry:

RA/DEC → unit vectors

Segment vectors

Great-circle axis estimation

Angular residuals

Curvature sign and magnitude

Combined anomaly score

Outputs
Output	Description
fgoc_flag	Boolean anomaly indicator
fgoc_score	Combined geometry–curvature score
focal_axis	Estimated great-circle axis
curvature_sign	+1 or –1
LSST Integration Notes

FGOC is designed specifically for LSST Prompt Processing and short-arc diagnostics.

Integration point

DIASource → FGOC → Pre-Linker → MOPS

Perfect for shadow-mode

Useful for:

commissioning tests

astrometric stability diagnostics

AOS closed-loop behavior evaluation

early anomaly detection

pre-linking prioritization

No impact on existing LSST/AP/MOPS logic

FGOC does not modify:

DIASource tables

Pre-Linker heuristics

Alert Production rules

orbit fitting routines

Benchmark Performance
Arc length	Runtime	Notes
2 detections	~0.20 ms	minimum geometry
3 detections	0.30–0.50 ms	full curvature
4–5 detections	0.60–0.80 ms	highly stable

FGOC remains robust under realistic astrometric noise.

Use Cases

Early ISO identification

Anomalous NEO motion

Astrometric diagnostics

Pre-linking prioritization
